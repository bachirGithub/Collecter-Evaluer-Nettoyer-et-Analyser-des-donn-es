## Context
It is about collecting data from different source files and carrying out their analysis to bring out certain conclusions.
The dataset we process (and analyze and visualize) is the Twitter user's tweet archive<a href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates">@dog_rates</a>, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs">WeRateDogs</a> (twiter_archive_enhanced.csv).
The image_predictions.tsv file contains predictions on dogs, predictions made based on neural networks.
The tweet_json.txt file contains additional data collected through the twitter API using tweet ids. These data include, among other things, the number of retweets, the number of favourites, etc.
## The wrangle_report(.ipynb or .pdf) file
It contains details of the steps followed in the data preparation process.
## The act_report file (.ipynb or .pdf)
